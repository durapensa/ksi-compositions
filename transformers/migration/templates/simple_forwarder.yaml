# Template for handlers that just forward events with minimal transformation
# Example usage: @event_handler("source:event") -> emit_event("target:event", data)

template_variables:
  - source_event: "Source event pattern to listen for"
  - target_event: "Target event to emit to"
  - mapping_type: "simple|passthrough|field_mapping"
  - service_name: "Name of service this transformer belongs to"

transformers:
  # Simple pass-through - just forward everything
  - source: "{{source_event}}"
    target: "{{target_event}}"
    mapping: "{{$}}"  # Pass entire event data
    description: "Forward {{source_event}} to {{target_event}} with no changes"

  # Simple field mapping - extract specific fields
  - source: "{{source_event}}"
    target: "{{target_event}}"
    mapping:
      # Common fields to map
      entity_id: "{{id|entity_id|agent_id}}"
      timestamp: "{{timestamp_utc()}}"
      event_type: "{{type|event_type}}"
      data: "{{$}}"  # Include original data
    description: "Forward {{source_event}} to {{target_event}} with field mapping"

  # Enhanced forwarding with metadata
  - source: "{{source_event}}"
    target: "{{target_event}}"
    mapping:
      original_event: "{{$}}"
      metadata:
        forwarded_by: "{{_ksi_context._agent_id|system}}"
        forwarded_at: "{{timestamp_utc()}}"
        service: "{{service_name}}"
    description: "Forward {{source_event}} to {{target_event}} with metadata enrichment"

# Common patterns for simple forwarders
common_patterns:
  status_propagation:
    source: "{{service}}:status_changed"
    target: "monitor:{{service}}_status"
    mapping:
      service: "{{service_name}}"
      status: "{{status}}"
      previous_status: "{{previous_status|unknown}}"
      timestamp: "{{timestamp_utc()}}"

  lifecycle_events:
    source: "{{service}}:{{event_type}}"
    target: "monitor:{{service}}_lifecycle"
    mapping:
      service: "{{service_name}}"
      event_type: "{{event_type}}"
      entity_id: "{{id}}"
      data: "{{$}}"
      timestamp: "{{timestamp_utc()}}"

usage_notes: |
  Simple forwarders are handlers that:
  1. Take an input event
  2. Emit another event with minimal transformation
  3. Do not contain complex business logic
  4. Can be replaced with declarative transformers
  
  This template covers ~30-40% of all KSI event handlers.
  Use {{$}} for complete pass-through of event data.
  Use field mapping when you need to restructure data.
