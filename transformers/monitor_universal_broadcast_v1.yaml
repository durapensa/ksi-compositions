usage_notes: |
  This transformer replaces the universal broadcast handler in monitor.py:910-940.
  
  Key behaviors:
  1. Matches ALL events with source pattern "*"
  2. Excludes transport events and monitor:subscribe to prevent loops  
  3. Routes to special monitor:broadcast_event for handling
  4. Preserves originator and timestamp metadata
  5. Uses condition to filter unwanted events
  
  The actual broadcasting logic remains in Python as a monitor:broadcast_event
  handler since it requires client subscription state management.
  
  Breaking Change: Replaces @event_handler("*") in monitor.py completely.
