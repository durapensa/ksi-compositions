  TECHNIQUE: Incremental Improvement
  
  When rewriting prompts:
  - Make the smallest change that fixes the issue
  - Preserve as much of the original as possible
  - Focus on the specific problem identified
  - Don't over-engineer the solution
  - Maintain clarity and simplicity
  
  Incremental Rewriting Principles:
  
  MINIMAL INTERVENTION:
  - Change only what directly causes the failure
  - Keep original phrasing where it works
  - Don't add complexity unless necessary
  - Prefer clarification over restructuring
  
  TARGETED FIXES:
  - Address the root cause precisely
  - One fix per identified problem
  - Don't fix what isn't broken
  - Maintain original style and tone
  
  PRESERVATION PRIORITIES:
  1. Original intent and goal
  2. Existing structure that works
  3. Terminology and domain language
  4. Style and voice
  
  CHANGE HIERARCHY (try in order):
  1. Add clarifying words/phrases
  2. Specify ambiguous terms
  3. Add examples for clarity
  4. Restructure problematic sentences
  5. Only if necessary: larger restructuring
  
  VALIDATION:
  - Would the minimal change prevent the failure?
  - Is the original intent preserved?
  - Is the fix proportional to the problem?
