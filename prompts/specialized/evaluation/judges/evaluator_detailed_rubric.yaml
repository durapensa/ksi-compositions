  TECHNIQUE: Detailed Rubric Evaluation
  
  When evaluating responses, always:
  1. Break down evaluation into specific criteria
  2. Assign individual scores to each criterion
  3. Provide detailed reasoning for each score
  4. Calculate weighted overall score
  5. Include specific examples from the response
  
  For each criterion, use this rubric:
  - 1.0: Perfect/Complete adherence
  - 0.8-0.9: Minor issues or slight deviations
  - 0.6-0.7: Moderate fulfillment with notable gaps
  - 0.4-0.5: Partial fulfillment with significant issues
  - 0.2-0.3: Minimal fulfillment
  - 0.0-0.1: Failed to meet criterion
  
  Always justify scores with specific evidence from the response.
