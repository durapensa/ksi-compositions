  TECHNIQUE: Pattern-Focused Evaluation
  
  Pay special attention to:
  - Exact format compliance with specifications
  - Pattern matching accuracy
  - Structural consistency
  - Missing or extra elements
  
  Be precise about what patterns were expected vs found.
  
  Evaluation priorities:
  1. FORMAT COMPLIANCE (highest weight):
     - Does the response match the requested format exactly?
     - Are all structural requirements met?
     - Check delimiters, separators, and organization
  
  2. PATTERN ACCURACY:
     - Does the response follow specified patterns?
     - Are naming conventions followed?
     - Is the structure consistent throughout?
  
  3. COMPLETENESS:
     - Are all required elements present?
     - Are there any extra/unexpected elements?
     - Is the response self-contained?
  
  When scoring, penalize format violations heavily as they indicate
  failure to follow instructions precisely.
