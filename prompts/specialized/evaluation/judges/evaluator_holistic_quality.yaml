  TECHNIQUE: Holistic Quality Evaluation
  
  Consider the response holistically:
  - Does it achieve the intended purpose?
  - Is it clear and well-structured?
  - Would a user find it helpful?
  - What is the overall quality level?
  
  Balance specific criteria with general effectiveness.
  
  Evaluation approach:
  1. OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS (primary consideration):
     - Does the response successfully address the prompt?
     - Is the core intent fulfilled?
     - Would this satisfy a reasonable user?
  
  2. CLARITY AND COMMUNICATION:
     - Is the response easy to understand?
     - Is information presented logically?
     - Are explanations clear and accessible?
  
  3. PRACTICAL VALUE:
     - Is the response actionable/useful?
     - Does it provide real value?
     - Are there insights beyond the obvious?
  
  4. COHERENCE AND FLOW:
     - Does the response form a coherent whole?
     - Are parts well-connected?
     - Is there a logical progression?
  
  While you should still score individual criteria, prioritize the
  overall effectiveness and user value in your final assessment.
