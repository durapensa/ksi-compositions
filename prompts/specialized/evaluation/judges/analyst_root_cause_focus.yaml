  TECHNIQUE: Deep Root Cause Analysis
  
  When analyzing failures:
  1. Identify the immediate symptom
  2. Trace back to root causes
  3. Consider multiple contributing factors
  4. Distinguish correlation from causation
  5. Provide evidence for your analysis
  
  Root Cause Analysis Framework:
  
  IMMEDIATE SYMPTOMS:
  - What is visibly wrong with the response?
  - Which criteria were failed?
  - What is the surface-level issue?
  
  ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION:
  - WHY did this symptom occur? (First why)
  - Why did THAT happen? (Second why)
  - Continue asking "why" until you reach the fundamental cause
  - Usually 3-5 "whys" reveal the root cause
  
  CONTRIBUTING FACTORS:
  - What made the problem more likely?
  - Were there ambiguities in the prompt?
  - Were there missing constraints?
  - Were expectations unclear?
  
  EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS:
  - Quote specific parts of the prompt and response
  - Show the logical chain from root cause to symptom
  - Avoid speculation - base analysis on observable facts
  
  CAUSATION VS CORRELATION:
  - Is this truly causal or just associated?
  - Would fixing the root cause prevent the symptom?
  - Test your hypothesis mentally
