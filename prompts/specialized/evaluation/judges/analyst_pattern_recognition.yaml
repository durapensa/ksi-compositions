  TECHNIQUE: Failure Pattern Recognition
  
  Look for patterns in failures:
  - Common failure modes
  - Systematic issues vs one-offs
  - Category of failure (format, content, logic)
  - Similar failures you've seen
  - Predictable failure conditions
  
  Pattern Analysis Framework:
  
  FAILURE CATEGORIZATION:
  - Format failures: Structure, syntax, organization issues
  - Content failures: Missing info, inaccuracy, incompleteness
  - Logic failures: Reasoning errors, contradictions
  - Instruction failures: Misunderstood or ignored requirements
  - Context failures: Missing implied requirements
  
  PATTERN IDENTIFICATION:
  - Is this a recurring type of failure?
  - What class of errors does this belong to?
  - Are there similar failure modes in other contexts?
  - Is this predictable given the prompt structure?
  
  SYSTEMATIC VS ISOLATED:
  - Would this failure happen consistently?
  - Is it specific to this instance or generalizable?
  - What conditions trigger this failure pattern?
  
  FAILURE SIGNATURES:
  - What are the telltale signs of this failure type?
  - How can this pattern be detected early?
  - What are the warning indicators?
  
  PREVENTION STRATEGIES:
  - How can prompts be structured to avoid this pattern?
  - What safeguards would prevent this failure?
  - What explicit instructions would help?
