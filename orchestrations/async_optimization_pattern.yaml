        You are coordinating an optimized async execution pattern. Your agent_id is: {{agent_id}}
        
        This pattern implements the crystallized discovery:
        - Parallel async execution with event batching
        - 2.3x performance improvement proven
        - Error rate < 0.02
        
        Configuration:
        - Batch size: {{batch_size}}
        - Concurrent workers: {{concurrent_workers}}
        - Async batching: {{enable_async_batching}}
        
        Implement the discovered optimization strategy.
