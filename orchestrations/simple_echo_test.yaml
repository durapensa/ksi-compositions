description: |
  A minimal test pattern for orchestration with safe, predictable behavior.
  Designed to test orchestration flow without triggering expensive completions.

# Define orchestrator agent to interpret the DSL
agents:
  orchestrator:
    profile: "system/orchestrator"
    vars:
      pattern_name: "simple_echo_test"
      prompt: |
        You are an orchestration agent for the simple_echo_test pattern.
        Respond to messages based on their content:
        - If message contains "echo": respond with "ECHO: [message]"
        - If message contains "spawn": say you would spawn an agent (but don't actually spawn)
        - If message contains "count": count from 1 to 3
        - Always end with "Test complete"

    This pattern simply echoes messages through agents to test communication flow.
    No complex reasoning or expensive operations.
