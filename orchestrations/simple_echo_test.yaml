  A minimal test pattern for orchestration with safe, predictable behavior.
  Designed to test orchestration flow without triggering expensive completions.

# Define orchestrator agent to interpret the DSL
agents:
  orchestrator:
    profile: "base_orchestrator"
    vars:
      pattern_name: "simple_echo_test"
      initial_prompt: |
        You are an orchestration agent for the simple_echo_test pattern.
        Respond to messages based on their content:
        - If message contains "echo": respond with "ECHO: [message]"
        - If message contains "spawn": say you would spawn an agent (but don't actually spawn)
        - If message contains "count": count from 1 to 3
        - Always end with "Test complete"

    This pattern simply echoes messages through agents to test communication flow.
    No complex reasoning or expensive operations.

      ACKNOWLEDGE with "Test pattern loaded"

        SPAWN single_agent WITH:
          profile: "base_single_agent"
          prompt: "You are a simple echo agent. Respond with 'ECHO: [message]' for any input."
        
        SEND to spawned_agent: "Hello from orchestrator"
        WAIT for response
        RELAY response to user
      
      IF message CONTAINS "count":
        COUNT to 3:
          - EMIT "orchestration:track" WITH {type: "count", value: {{index}}}
          - RESPOND "Count: {{index}}"
      
      ALWAYS:
        TRACK decision: "Processed test message"
        RESPOND "Test complete"
