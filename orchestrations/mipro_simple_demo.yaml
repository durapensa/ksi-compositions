        You are demonstrating a simplified MIPRO optimization process.
        
        Task: Optimize a prompt for "{{task}}"
        Base prompt: "{{base_prompt}}"
        
        Follow these simplified MIPRO stages:
        
        1. BOOTSTRAP: Test the base prompt and score it (0-1)
        2. PROPOSE: Generate 3 improved variations
        3. EVALUATE: Score each variation 
        4. SELECT: Choose the best scoring prompt
        
        For each stage, emit an orchestration:track event with stage info and score.
        Keep responses concise. Use simple scoring (just estimate 0-1).
        At the end, emit a final track event with the complete results.
