# Natural language DSL designed for AI interpretation

  description: |
    This DSL is designed to be interpreted by AI orchestrators, focusing on
    intent and context rather than rigid syntax. The language blends declarative
    goals with adaptive strategies.
  
  strategy: |
    INITIALIZE tournament WITH context:
      ASSESS participants.capabilities USING "composition:discover"
      ANALYZE task.complexity AND participant.diversity
      SYNTHESIZE optimal_format FROM historical_patterns
      
      IF high_capability_variance OR complex_task:
        CONFIGURE adaptive_matching WITH swiss_pairing
        ENABLE dynamic_complexity_adjustment
      ELSE:
        CONFIGURE round_robin WITH parallel_execution
    
    DURING each_round:
      OBSERVE performance_metrics IN_REALTIME
      MAINTAIN context_window OF recent_interactions
      
      WHEN performance_anomaly_detected:
        INTROSPECT root_cause USING "orchestration:analyze"
        ADAPT strategy BASED_ON analysis.insights
        EMIT "composition:track_decision" WITH {
          decision: strategy_adaptation,
          reasoning: analysis.insights,
          confidence: self.confidence_score
        }
      
      IF consensus_forming AND rounds_remaining > 2:
        ACCELERATE convergence BY:
          - INCREASING test_discriminators
          - FOCUSING on_boundary_cases
          - REDUCING redundant_comparisons
      
      CONTINUOUSLY:
        BALANCE exploration VS exploitation
        OPTIMIZE for_signal NOT noise
        LEARN from_each_interaction
    
    ORCHESTRATE parallel_evaluations:
      SPAWN evaluator_agents WITH diverse_perspectives
      DISTRIBUTE tests USING capability_aware_routing
      
      FOR each_evaluation:
        PROVIDE minimal_sufficient_context
        ALLOW emergent_evaluation_criteria
        CAPTURE reasoning_traces
      
      AGGREGATE results USING "orchestration:aggregate" WITH {
        method: "weighted_consensus",
        weights: DERIVE_FROM agent.track_record,
        confidence_threshold: ADAPTIVE_BASED_ON variance
      }
    
    AFTER tournament_completion:
      SYNTHESIZE learnings FROM all_decisions
      IDENTIFY emergent_patterns IN strategy_adaptations
      
      IF performance > baseline * 1.2:
        CRYSTALLIZE successful_patterns INTO new_composition
        SHARE insights WITH pattern_ecosystem
      
      REFLECT on_orchestration_effectiveness:
        - What strategies emerged naturally?
        - Which adaptations improved outcomes?
        - How did context influence decisions?
