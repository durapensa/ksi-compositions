  Test pattern demonstrating all orchestration improvements:
  - Pattern validation with valid profiles
  - Default routing for unmatched messages
  - Initial messages sent on spawn
  - Self-termination by orchestrator

# Define agents with valid profiles
agents:
  coordinator:
    profile: "base_orchestrator"
    initial_message: "test_coordinator_init"  # Will be created next
    
  worker:
    profile: "base_single_agent"
    initial_message: "test_worker_init"       # Will be created next

# Routing with default target
routing:
  default: "coordinator"  # Unmatched messages go to coordinator
  rules:
    # Coordinator can message worker
    - pattern: "task"
      from: "coordinator"
      to: "worker"
      
    # Worker responses go back to coordinator
    - pattern: "result"
      from: "worker"
      to: "coordinator"

  max_tasks: 3

# Expected flow:
# 1. Both agents spawn and receive initial messages
# 2. External message routes to coordinator via default
# 3. Coordinator sends tasks to worker
# 4. Worker sends results back
# 5. Coordinator self-terminates after max_tasks
