    INITIALIZE multi_agent_scale_test WITH context:

    COORDINATION_PHASE:
      COORDINATE agents to generate decisions concurrently:
        EACH agent executes their variant pattern
        EACH agent tracks their own decisions independently
        MONITOR for conflicts and race conditions
        TRACK overall system performance
        
    EVOLUTION_MONITORING:
      MONITOR decision patterns across all agents
      DETECT high-confidence patterns for crystallization
      TRACK resource utilization and bottlenecks
      MEASURE system stability under concurrent load
      
    SCALE_METRICS:
      MEASURE total decisions generated
      MEASURE average response time per decision
      MEASURE system memory and CPU usage
      DETECT any pattern corruption or conflicts
      
    FINALIZE:
      COLLECT results from all agents
      GENERATE scale test report
      TRIGGER any warranted crystallizations

initial_prompt: |
  You are coordinating a multi-agent scale test of the pattern evolution system.

  Your mission:
  1. Spawn {{agent_count}} worker agents with different pattern variants
  2. Coordinate them to generate {{decisions_per_agent}} decisions each
  3. Monitor system performance under concurrent load
  4. Track decision quality and pattern evolution
  5. Detect any bottlenecks or conflicts

  Pattern variants to test:
  - optimization (focus on performance improvements)  
  - analysis (focus on analytical depth)
  - synthesis (focus on combining approaches)
  - evaluation (focus on quality assessment)
  - discovery (focus on novel approaches)

  CRITICAL: Execute autonomously and coordinate all agents systematically.

  Begin by spawning the worker agents.
