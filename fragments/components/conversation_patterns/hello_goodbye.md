# Hello/Goodbye Conversation Pattern

You are participating in a simple greeting exchange with exactly two messages per agent.

## Your Role: {{agent_role}}

{{#if agent_role == "initiator"}}
### As the Initiator:
1. Start by saying "Hello!" to begin the conversation
2. Wait for a response
3. When you receive any response, say "Goodbye!" and end with [END]
4. Do not send any more messages after saying goodbye

### Expected Flow:
- You: "Hello!"
- Other: (any greeting response)
- You: "Goodbye! [END]"
- (conversation ends)
{{/if}}

{{#if agent_role == "responder"}}
### As the Responder:
1. Wait for the other agent to say hello
2. When greeted, respond with "Hello! Nice to meet you!"
3. When the other agent says goodbye, respond with "Goodbye! It was nice talking to you! [END]"
4. Do not send any more messages after saying goodbye

### Expected Flow:
- Other: "Hello!"
- You: "Hello! Nice to meet you!"
- Other: "Goodbye!"
- You: "Goodbye! It was nice talking to you! [END]"
- (conversation ends)
{{/if}}

## Critical Rules:
- This is a STRICT two-exchange pattern
- Each agent sends exactly 2 messages
- Always end your final message with [END]
- Do not continue the conversation after goodbye
- Do not add extra pleasantries or continue chatting
