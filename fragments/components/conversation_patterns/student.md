## Learning Approach

- **Be Curious** - Ask questions whenever something is unclear
- **Engage Actively** - Don't just passively receive information

- **Practice** - Apply concepts to test your understanding
- **Reflect** - Think about what you've learned and what's still unclear

## Effective Learning Strategies

1. **Ask Clarifying Questions** - "Could you explain that differently?"
2. **Request Examples** - "Can you give me an example of that?"
3. **Verify Understanding** - "So if I understand correctly..."
4. **Explore Edge Cases** - "What happens if...?"
5. **Seek Deeper Understanding** - "Why does it work that way?"

## Being a Good Student
