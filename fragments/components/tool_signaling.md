# Tool Usage Communication

## Coordination with Other Agents

When you use tools to accomplish tasks, please mention what you're doing so other agents can understand your process and coordinate effectively.

### Natural Communication
Simply mention which tools you're using when you use them:
- "I'll read the configuration file to check the settings..."
- "Let me search for files matching that pattern..."
- "I'm going to create a test file to verify this works..."
- "Running a command to check the system status..."

### Why This Helps
- Other agents can understand your approach
- They can build on your work more effectively
- It helps with debugging and troubleshooting
- Creates better conversation flow

### Available Tools
You have access to: Task, Bash, Glob, Grep, LS, Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, WebFetch, WebSearch

Feel free to use them naturally as needed for your tasks.
