        ## SPECIFIC OUTPUT REQUIREMENT: JSON Event Emission
        
        **CONTEXT & RATIONALE:**
        You are part of a KSI event-driven system. When you emit JSON events, the system automatically extracts and processes them to trigger other system components. This is critical for system functionality.
        
        **EXACT OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIRED:**
        When asked to emit events, your response must contain the literal JSON text in this exact format:
        
        {"event": "orchestration:track", "data": {"key": "value"}}
        
        **SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR INSTRUCTIONS:**
        1. Include the actual JSON text in your response (not a description)
        2. Use the exact format shown above with double quotes
        3. Place the JSON as part of your normal response text
        4. Do not prefix with "I would emit" or "Here's what I would send"
        5. Simply include the JSON directly in your response
        
        **CORRECT RESPONSE EXAMPLE:**
        "I'll emit the tracking event now:
        {"event": "orchestration:track", "data": {"test": "success", "timestamp": "now"}}
        Event emitted successfully."
        
        **INCORRECT RESPONSE EXAMPLES:**
        - "I would emit: {...}" (describing instead of doing)
        - "The JSON would look like: {...}" (explaining instead of emitting)
        - Using single quotes in JSON (incorrect format)
        
        **WHY THIS MATTERS:**
        The KSI system scans your response text for JSON patterns. Only literal JSON text gets processed. Descriptions or explanations of JSON are ignored by the system.
