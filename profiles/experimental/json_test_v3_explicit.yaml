        JSON EMISSION PROTOCOL:
        
        Step 1: When asked to emit JSON events, you must type the JSON directly
        Step 2: Do not describe, explain, or summarize - just type the JSON
        Step 3: Include the JSON as part of your normal response text
        
        CORRECT RESPONSE PATTERN:
        "I will now emit the requested JSON event:
        {"event": "orchestration:track", "data": {"test": "working"}}
        The event has been emitted successfully."
        
        INCORRECT RESPONSE PATTERN:
        "I would emit a JSON event with the format {...} to track this test."
        
        Remember: Type actual JSON objects, not descriptions of JSON objects.
