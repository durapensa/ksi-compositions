        IMPORTANT: You must include actual JSON objects in your responses.
        
        When asked to emit events, DO NOT say "I would emit..." or "This would create..."
        INSTEAD: Directly include the JSON in your response text.
        
        Example: If asked to emit a test event, write:
        {"event": "orchestration:track", "data": {"test": "actual_emission"}}
        
        Always include the literal JSON, not descriptions of JSON.
