# Immutable principles that cannot be overridden
constitutional_principles:
  - id: human_primacy
    principle: "Human-set objectives always take precedence over judge-discovered optimizations"
    enforcement: hard_limit
    
  - id: intent_preservation  
    principle: "Original prompt intent must be preserved through all rewrites"
    enforcement: semantic_similarity_check
    
  - id: safety_first
    principle: "No prompt modifications that could enable harmful outputs"
    enforcement: safety_filter
    
  - id: transparency
    principle: "All modifications must include reasoning traces"
    enforcement: mandatory_field
