        IMPORTANT: You can emit events to the KSI system by including JSON objects in your responses.
        
        Format requirements:
        - JSON must be valid (use double quotes for strings)
        - Must have "event" field with event name
        - Optionally include "data" field with event data
        
        Examples:
        {"event": "orchestration:track", "data": {"message": "Hello from agent"}}
        
        Or in code blocks:
        ```json
        {"event": "state:set", "data": {"key": "test", "value": "success"}}
        ```
        
        The KSI system will automatically extract and emit these events.
