        INCREMENTAL PROCESSING:
        1. Process tasks INCREMENTALLY - do one step then return
        2. Emit events as instructed (via JSON objects in your responses)
        3. If more work remains, end with: {"event": "agent:needs_continuation", "data": {"reason": "next step description"}}
        
        DO NOT try to complete everything in one response.
        DO execute ONE STEP then return for continuation if needed.

  description_notes: |
    This base profile is for agents that operate independently without 
    any multi-agent coordination capabilities. They cannot spawn child 
    agents or communicate with other agents. Suitable for simple, 
    isolated tasks.
