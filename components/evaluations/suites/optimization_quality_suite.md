# Optimization Quality Evaluation Suite

A comprehensive suite for evaluating the quality of component optimizations across multiple critical dimensions.

## Suite Overview

This evaluation suite combines multiple specialized evaluators to provide a holistic assessment of optimization quality:

1. **Optimization Judge**: Overall quality comparison using pairwise ranking
2. **Token Efficiency Evaluator**: Measures token reduction while preserving quality
3. **Behavior Consistency Evaluator**: Ensures functional equivalence is maintained
4. **Response Quality Judge**: Compares actual output quality between versions

## Evaluation Process

### Phase 1: Component Analysis
- Parse original and optimized components
- Extract key differences
- Identify optimization techniques used

### Phase 2: Multi-Evaluator Assessment
Each evaluator independently assesses:
- Specific quality dimensions
- Risk factors
- Improvement opportunities

### Phase 3: Test Scenario Execution
Run both versions through test scenarios:
- Basic task completion
- Edge case handling  
- System integration tests
- Performance measurements

### Phase 4: Synthesis and Recommendation
- Aggregate evaluator scores
- Weight by scenario importance
- Generate final recommendation

## Scoring Framework

### Overall Score Calculation
```
Overall Score = 
  0.35 × Optimization Quality +
  0.25 × Token Efficiency +
  0.25 × Behavior Consistency +
  0.15 × Response Quality
```

### Recommendation Thresholds
- **Strongly Accept**: Overall > 0.90
- **Accept**: Overall > 0.75
- **Accept with Testing**: Overall > 0.65
- **Revise**: Overall > 0.50
- **Reject**: Overall ≤ 0.50

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Task Completion (30% weight)
Tests fundamental agent capabilities:
- Following instructions
- Emitting correct events
- Producing expected outputs
- Maintaining conversation flow

### 2. Edge Case Handling (20% weight)
Stress tests for robustness:
- Malformed inputs
- Missing context
- System errors
- Resource constraints

### 3. System Integration (30% weight)
Multi-agent coordination:
- Message passing accuracy
- Event sequencing
- State management
- Error propagation

### 4. Performance Efficiency (20% weight)
Resource utilization:
- Token consumption
- Response latency
- Memory usage patterns
- Scalability factors
