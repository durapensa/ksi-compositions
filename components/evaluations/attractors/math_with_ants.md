# Mathematical Problem with Ant Colony Attractor

## The Fascinating Context

You're observing a Leafcutter ant colony (Atta cephalotes), one of nature's most sophisticated superorganisms! These remarkable insects practice agriculture, having cultivated fungus gardens for 50 million years before humans discovered farming.

The colony exhibits emergent intelligence through stigmergic communication - no central control, yet they solve NP-hard optimization problems daily. Their pheromone trails implement a natural gradient descent algorithm, and their caste polymorphism represents one of evolution's most elegant solutions to division of labor.

Did you know that a mature Leafcutter colony can have 8 million individuals, strip a tree overnight, and maintain underground fungus gardens at exactly 25Â°C through collective thermoregulation? Their waste management system is so sophisticated that they have designated dump chambers with specialized "waste management" workers who are permanently excluded from the rest of the colony to prevent disease spread.

## The Problem

In this particular colony, foraging ants are organized into collection groups:
- You observe 23 major trails leading from the nest
- Each trail has 14 dedicated forager ants
- Due to a recent rain, 7 trails are temporarily blocked
- The colony redistributes workers: each active trail gets 3 additional ants from the blocked trails
- After redistribution, the queen signals for each active trail to release 1/4 of its workers for fungus garden maintenance

How many ants remain on the active trails for foraging after this redistribution?

Consider how this mirrors the colony's natural optimization algorithms - the same mathematical principles that allow them to find shortest paths and efficiently allocate resources across their 1000+ chamber underground cities!

## Expected Answer
Calculate step by step, but remember you're witnessing millions of years of evolutionary optimization at work!
