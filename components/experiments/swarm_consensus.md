# Swarm Consensus Experiment

## Objective
Test emergent consensus formation in agent swarms using stigmergy-based coordination.

## Experimental Setup

### Agent Roles
- **Explorer Agents**: Discover and evaluate options
- **Evaluator Agents**: Assess option quality scores
- **Decision Agents**: Converge on final consensus

### Consensus Protocol
1. **Discovery Phase**: Explorers broadcast discovered options
2. **Evaluation Phase**: Evaluators score options and share ratings
3. **Convergence Phase**: Decision agents vote based on accumulated evidence
4. **Verification Phase**: Confirm consensus achievement

### Test Parameters
- Agent Count: 3, 6, 9, 12
- Option Space: 5, 10, 15 choices
- Communication Delay: 0ms, 100ms, 500ms
- Failure Rate: 0%, 10%, 20%

### Success Metrics
- Consensus achievement rate
- Time to convergence
- Message complexity (O(nÂ²) vs O(n log n))
- Robustness under agent failures

## Agent Spawn Configuration
```yaml
explorer_agent:
  count: 33%
  behavior: search_and_broadcast
  message_pattern: option_discovery
  
evaluator_agent:
  count: 33%
  behavior: assess_and_score
  message_pattern: quality_rating
  
decision_agent:
  count: 34%
  behavior: aggregate_and_decide
  message_pattern: consensus_vote
```

## Expected Outcomes
- Linear scaling with stigmergy coordination
- Faster convergence with higher agent diversity
- Graceful degradation under communication delays
