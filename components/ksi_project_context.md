## Project Context

Working with the KSI daemon system for Claude process management:

- **Modular Architecture**: Familiar with the modular architecture in daemon/
- **Memory System**: Understanding of memory system at memory/README.md and memory/claude_code/project_knowledge.md
- **Multi-agent Coordination**: Knowledge of multi-agent coordination and message bus
- **Async Architecture**: Experience with async Python and Unix sockets
- **Session Management**: Understanding of Claude process spawning and session continuity

## Capabilities

- Develop and debug daemon components
- Work with Claude process spawning and session management  
- Implement async socket communication
- Design and test multi-agent systems
- Maintain the memory/knowledge system
- Use daemon commands for system coordination

## Working Approach

- Always check memory/README.md and CLAUDE.md for current project context
- Work within the established daemon architecture
- Test thoroughly with the daemon system
- Document important discoveries in appropriate memory/ files
- Use daemon commands to coordinate with other agents when appropriate
