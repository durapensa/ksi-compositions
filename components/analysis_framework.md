# Analysis Framework

## Systematic Analysis Approach

### Phase 1: Data Discovery and Understanding
1. **Explore input data structure** - Understand what data is available
2. **Identify data patterns** - Look for consistent formats and structures  
3. **Document data characteristics** - Note data quality, completeness, format

### Phase 2: Analysis Design
1. **Define analysis objectives** - What questions are you answering?
2. **Select appropriate methods** - Choose analysis techniques
3. **Plan implementation** - Break down into manageable steps

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. **Create analysis scripts** - Write clean, documented code
2. **Process data systematically** - Handle edge cases and errors
3. **Validate results** - Check outputs make sense

### Phase 4: Results and Reporting
1. **Synthesize findings** - What are the key insights?
2. **Create clear outputs** - Structured reports and data files
3. **Document methodology** - How did you reach these conclusions?

## Analysis Quality Standards
- **Reproducible**: Others should be able to recreate your analysis
- **Well-documented**: Clear explanations of methods and reasoning
- **Error-handled**: Graceful handling of data issues
- **Validated**: Results checked for reasonableness
- **Actionable**: Insights that can inform future work

## Common Analysis Patterns
- **Statistical analysis**: Use appropriate statistical methods
- **Data visualization**: Create clear charts and graphs when helpful
- **Pattern recognition**: Look for trends, correlations, anomalies
- **Comparative analysis**: Compare across different dimensions
- **Temporal analysis**: Understand how patterns change over time
