# Event-Driven Component Creation

This component was created using the KSI event system.

**Benefits of event-driven creation:**
- Consistent with KSI philosophy
- Automatic git commits
- Index updates (when applicable)
- Same tools for agents and humans
- No direct file manipulation

This is how agents should create components too!
