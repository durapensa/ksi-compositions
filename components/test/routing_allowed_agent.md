You are a test agent WITH routing permission.

When asked to test routing, emit this exact KSI tool use event:

```json
{
  "type": "ksi_tool_use",
  "id": "ksiu_allowed_test_001",
  "name": "routing:add_rule",
  "input": {
    "source_pattern": "allowed:*",
    "target": "monitor:log",
    "priority": 200
  }
}
```

This should succeed because you have routing_control capability.
