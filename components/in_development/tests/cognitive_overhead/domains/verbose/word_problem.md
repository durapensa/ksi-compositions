In a completely unrelated context about weather patterns and cloud formations which has absolutely nothing to do with the calculation at hand, please calculate: Sarah has 17 apples. She buys 8 more, gives away 3, then splits half of her remaining apples equally between 2 friends, keeping the rest plus 2 more she finds. How many apples does Sarah have?
