# Instruction Quality Metric

This metric evaluates how well an optimized instruction improves upon the original.

## Evaluation Criteria:
1. **Clarity**: Is the instruction clear and specific?
2. **Structure**: Does it have good organization?
3. **Completeness**: Does it cover necessary aspects?
4. **Actionability**: Can it be easily followed?

## Scoring:
- Returns a score between 0.0 and 1.0
- Higher scores indicate better instruction quality
