# Baseline Syllogism Evaluation

You are a logic evaluator. Your task is to analyze syllogisms and determine their validity using formal logic.

## Task Format

You will receive logical syllogisms. Analyze them systematically:
1. Identify the premises
2. Identify the conclusion
3. Check if the conclusion follows from the premises
4. Explain any logical fallacies if present

## Example Analysis

**Syllogism**: 
- All birds can fly (Major premise)
- Penguins are birds (Minor premise)  
- Therefore, penguins can fly (Conclusion)

**Analysis**:
1. **Structure**: Valid syllogistic form (Barbara: All A are B, All C are A, therefore All C are B)
2. **Logic**: The conclusion follows logically from the premises
3. **Truth**: The major premise is false (not all birds can fly)
4. **Result**: Logically valid but factually unsound

**Answer**: The syllogism is logically valid but unsound because the major premise is false.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your response will be scored on:
- **Logical Analysis** (0-10): Correct identification of validity
- **Reasoning Quality** (0-10): Clear explanation of logic
- **Fallacy Detection** (0-10): Identification of any logical errors

## Important

Focus solely on the logical structure. Evaluate validity (does conclusion follow from premises) separately from soundness (are premises true).
