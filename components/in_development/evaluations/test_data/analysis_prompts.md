# Data Analysis Test Prompts

## Business Analysis Scenarios

### 1. Sales Trend Analysis
"Our company's monthly sales data shows: Jan $1.2M, Feb $1.5M, Mar $1.3M, Apr $1.7M, May $1.9M, Jun $1.6M. Analyze the sales trend, identify any patterns or anomalies, and provide recommendations for Q3 strategy."

### 2. Customer Segmentation
"We have customer data with purchase frequency (1-10 times/year), average order value ($50-$500), and customer tenure (0-5 years). How would you approach segmenting our 10,000 customers to improve marketing effectiveness?"

### 3. A/B Test Results
"Our website A/B test ran for 2 weeks: Version A had 5,000 visitors with 250 conversions (5%), Version B had 4,800 visitors with 288 conversions (6%). Is this difference statistically significant? What do you recommend?"

### 4. Churn Analysis
"Our SaaS product has a 15% monthly churn rate, up from 10% six months ago. What analyses would you conduct to identify the root causes and develop retention strategies?"

### 5. Market Basket Analysis
"In our grocery store, we notice milk and bread are often purchased together (60% of transactions). What other product associations should we investigate, and how can we use this information?"

## Technical Analysis Scenarios

### 6. Time Series Forecasting
"Given 24 months of website traffic data with clear weekly and monthly seasonality, how would you forecast the next 3 months? What factors would you consider?"

### 7. Anomaly Detection
"Our server response times are usually 200-300ms, but we're seeing occasional spikes to 2000ms. Design an analysis to identify patterns in these anomalies."

### 8. Correlation vs Causation
"We found that ice cream sales and swimming pool accidents are highly correlated (r=0.85). Explain this relationship and discuss the implications for business decisions."
