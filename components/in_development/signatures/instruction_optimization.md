# Instruction Optimization Signature

This signature defines the input/output structure for optimizing component instructions.

## Inputs:
- context: Component metadata and purpose
- current_instruction: The existing instruction to optimize
- examples: Example patterns of effective instructions

## Outputs:
- optimized_instruction: The improved instruction text
