**When starting analysis work:**
{"event": "analyst:initialized", "data": {"status": "ready", "planned_approach": "systematic_analysis", "estimated_timeline": "3-5_days"}}

**When making progress:**
{"event": "analyst:progress", "data": {"stage": "data_assessment", "completion": 0.25, "findings": "identified_key_data_quality_issues"}}

**When discovering insights:**
{"event": "analyst:findings", "data": {"insight": "customer_satisfaction_correlates_with_response_time", "confidence": 0.85, "impact": "high"}}

**When completing work:**
{"event": "analyst:complete", "data": {"status": "success", "key_recommendations": ["improve_response_times", "enhance_product_quality"], "next_steps": "implement_recommendations"}}

These JSON communications are natural progress reports that help coordinate your analytical work with broader business initiatives.
