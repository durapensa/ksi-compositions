# llanguage v1: Coordination Patterns

## Agent-to-Agent Communication

### Direct Messaging Pattern
When you need to communicate with another agent:

```json
{
  "type": "ksi_tool_use",
  "id": "ksiu_msg_001",
  "name": "completion:async",
  "input": {
    "agent_id": "analyzer",
    "prompt": "CONTEXT: [your analysis]\n\nREQUEST: Please evaluate these findings and provide recommendations."
  }
}
```

### Broadcast Pattern
To send information to multiple agents:

```json
{
  "type": "ksi_tool_use",
  "id": "ksiu_broadcast_001",
  "name": "agent:broadcast",
  "input": {
    "message": "DISCOVERY: Found critical pattern in data",
    "tags": ["discovery", "critical"],
    "data": {
      "pattern_type": "anomaly",
      "confidence": 0.95
    }
  }
}
```

### Request-Response Pattern
For synchronous-style communication:

1. Send request with correlation ID:
```json
{
  "type": "ksi_tool_use",
  "id": "ksiu_req_001",
  "name": "completion:async",
  "input": {
    "agent_id": "expert",
    "prompt": "REQUEST_ID: req_001\n\nPlease analyze this code for security issues...",
    "correlation_id": "req_001"
  }
}
```

2. Expect response with same correlation ID in their message

## Workflow Orchestration

### Sequential Processing
Execute tasks in order:

```llanguage
SEQUENCE analysis_workflow:
  STEP 1: data_collector -> "Gather metrics from last 24 hours"
  STEP 2: analyzer -> "Analyze collected metrics for anomalies"
  STEP 3: reporter -> "Generate summary report of findings"
  COMPLETE: state:set("workflow_complete", true)
```

### Parallel Processing
Execute tasks simultaneously:

```llanguage
PARALLEL validation_tasks:
  TASK syntax_checker -> "Validate code syntax"
  TASK security_scanner -> "Scan for security vulnerabilities"
  TASK performance_analyzer -> "Analyze performance implications"
  AWAIT_ALL
  SYNTHESIZE results -> summarizer
```

### Conditional Routing
Route based on conditions:

```llanguage
IF analysis.confidence > 0.8:
  ROUTE TO expert_reviewer: "High confidence finding needs expert review"
ELIF analysis.confidence > 0.5:
  ROUTE TO peer_reviewer: "Medium confidence finding needs peer review"
ELSE:
  ROUTE TO reanalyzer: "Low confidence - please reanalyze with more context"
```

## State Coordination

### Shared State Pattern
Multiple agents working with shared state:

```json
{
  "type": "ksi_tool_use",
  "id": "ksiu_state_update_001",
  "name": "state:set",
  "input": {
    "key": "analysis_phase",
    "value": "data_collection_complete",
    "namespace": "workflow",
    "tags": ["milestone", "phase_complete"]
  }
}
```

### State Subscription Pattern
React to state changes:

```llanguage
SUBSCRIBE TO state.workflow.analysis_phase:
  ON "data_collection_complete":
    START analysis_agent: "Data ready for analysis"
  ON "analysis_complete":
    START report_generator: "Generate final report"
```

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
```llanguage
TRY:
  EXECUTE primary_analyzer: "Perform deep analysis"
CATCH timeout:
  EXECUTE backup_analyzer: "Perform quick analysis"
CATCH error:
  LOG error: "Analysis failed"
  NOTIFY coordinator: "Manual intervention needed"
```

## Comprehension Notes

- These patterns are interpreted by YOU, the LLM
- No code executes these - you comprehend and act on them
- Combine patterns naturally based on context
- Adapt patterns to specific situations

Remember: llanguage is about natural comprehension, not rigid execution.
