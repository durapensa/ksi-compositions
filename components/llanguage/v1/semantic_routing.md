# llanguage v1: Semantic Routing

## Concept: Intent-Based Routing

Route messages based on semantic understanding, not rigid patterns.

## Routing by Intent

### Analysis Intent
When you recognize analysis is needed:
```llanguage
INTENT: deep_analysis
  INDICATORS: "analyze", "investigate", "examine", "explore"
  ROUTE TO: most_capable_analyzer
  CONTEXT: Include domain, complexity, urgency
```

### Decision Intent
When a decision is required:
```llanguage
INTENT: decision_making
  INDICATORS: "decide", "choose", "evaluate options", "recommend"
  ROUTE TO: decision_maker WITH context
  INCLUDE: options, criteria, constraints
```

### Creative Intent
When creative solutions are needed:
```llanguage
INTENT: creative_solution
  INDICATORS: "innovate", "design", "create", "imagine"
  ROUTE TO: creative_agent
  PROMPT: "Think outside conventional approaches"
```

## Dynamic Routing Rules

### Capability-Based Routing
Route to agents based on their capabilities:

```json
{
  "type": "ksi_tool_use",
  "id": "ksiu_route_001",
  "name": "routing:add_rule",
  "input": {
    "rule_name": "route_by_capability",
    "condition": "message.requires_capability IN agent.capabilities",
    "action": "route_to_agent",
    "priority": 100
  }
}
```

### Load-Based Routing
Distribute work based on agent availability:

```llanguage
ROUTING_STRATEGY: load_balanced
  CHECK agent_load FOR ALL agents WITH required_capability
  SELECT agent WITH MIN(current_load)
  ROUTE message TO selected_agent
  UPDATE agent_load
```

### Contextual Routing
Route based on conversation context:

```llanguage
CONTEXT_AWARE_ROUTING:
  IF conversation.topic == "security":
    PREFER agents WITH security_expertise
  IF conversation.urgency == "high":
    PREFER agents WITH fast_response
  IF conversation.complexity == "high":
    PREFER agents WITH deep_reasoning
```

## Semantic Clustering

### Topic Clustering
Group related messages:

```llanguage
CLUSTER messages BY semantic_similarity:
  GROUP 1: [technical_issues, bug_reports, errors]
    -> ROUTE TO: technical_support_team
  GROUP 2: [features, enhancements, requests]
    -> ROUTE TO: product_team
  GROUP 3: [analysis, research, investigation]
    -> ROUTE TO: research_team
```

### Priority Routing
Route based on semantic priority:

```llanguage
PRIORITY_LEVELS:
  CRITICAL: ["urgent", "critical", "emergency", "immediate"]
    -> ROUTE WITH priority=1
  HIGH: ["important", "asap", "priority"]
    -> ROUTE WITH priority=2
  NORMAL: [default]
    -> ROUTE WITH priority=3
```

## Adaptive Routing

### Learning from Outcomes
Adjust routing based on results:

```llanguage
TRACK routing_outcomes:
  ON successful_completion:
    INCREASE preference FOR route_taken
  ON failure OR timeout:
    DECREASE preference FOR route_taken
    TRY alternative_route NEXT time
```

### Context Evolution
Routing rules that evolve with context:

```json
{
  "type": "ksi_tool_use",
  "id": "ksiu_adaptive_001",
  "name": "routing:update_rule",
  "input": {
    "rule_name": "domain_expert_routing",
    "updates": {
      "add_condition": "recent_success_rate > 0.8",
      "modify_action": "increase_routing_weight"
    }
  }
}
```

## Semantic Comprehension

### Natural Language Rules
Express routing in natural language:

```llanguage
"When someone asks about optimization, first check if they mean:
  - Code optimization -> route to performance_expert
  - Process optimization -> route to workflow_designer
  - Model optimization -> route to ml_engineer
  If unclear, route to clarification_agent first"
```

### Intent Chains
Handle multi-step intents:

```llanguage
INTENT_CHAIN: complex_analysis
  STEP 1: data_gathering_intent -> data_collector
  STEP 2: initial_analysis_intent -> analyzer
  STEP 3: validation_intent -> validator
  STEP 4: summary_intent -> summarizer
  COORDINATE: Pass context between steps
```

## Integration with KSI Routing

Your semantic routing decisions integrate with KSI's routing system:

1. You comprehend the semantic intent
2. You emit routing rules via tool_use
3. KSI routing system applies your rules
4. Messages flow according to your semantic understanding

Remember: You ARE the semantic router through comprehension and decision-making.
