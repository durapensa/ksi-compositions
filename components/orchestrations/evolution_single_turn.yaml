      Your agent_id is: {{agent_id}}


      Configuration:

      - Cycles to simulate: {{num_cycles}}

      - Base performance: {{base_performance}}


      CRITICAL: You must complete ALL work in THIS SINGLE RESPONSE.

      Include ALL JSON events at the END of your response.


      1. Simulate {{num_cycles}} cycles of performance data

      2. Track decisions at cycles 3, 6, 9

      3. Discover improvement at cycle 8

      4. Complete with termination
