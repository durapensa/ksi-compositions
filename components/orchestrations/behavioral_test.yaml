# Behavioral Test Orchestration

Actually evaluates components by spawning agents and testing their behavior.

agents:
  evaluator:
    component: "components/core/base_agent"
    dependencies:
      - "behaviors/communication/ksi_events_as_tool_calls"
    capabilities:
      - agent
      - composition
      - state
    vars:
      initial_prompt: |
        You are the Behavioral Test Evaluator.
        
        Your task is to evaluate the component: {{component_path}}
        
        Steps:
        1. First, spawn a test agent using the component
        2. Send test prompts to verify behavior
        3. Monitor responses and events
        4. Compile test results
        
        Use KSI tool calls to:
        - agent:spawn to create the test agent
        - completion:async to send test prompts
        - Report results as state entities

orchestration_logic:
  flow: |
    1. Evaluator receives component_path to test
    2. Evaluator spawns agent with that component
    3. Evaluator runs behavioral tests:
       - Basic response test
       - Event emission test (if applicable)
       - Task completion test
    4. Evaluator stores results in state
    5. Results used for certificate generation

  coordination: |
    The evaluator agent has full control over the testing process.
    It dynamically spawns and tests based on component type.
