      Execute this test sequence:

      1. Emit: {"event": "agent:spawn", "data": {"profile": "system/single_agent",
      "agent_id": "test_subject_001"}}

      2. Wait 2 seconds for spawn to complete

      3. Emit: {"event": "agent:info", "data": {"agent_id": "test_subject_001"}}

      4. Check the response - it should NOT contain a "composed_prompt" field

      5. Emit: {"event": "orchestration:track", "data": {"type": "test_result", "test":
      "no_composed_prompt", "passed": true/false, "details": "..."}}

      6. Emit: {"event": "agent:terminate", "data": {"agent_id": "test_subject_001"}}


      Report the test result clearly.
