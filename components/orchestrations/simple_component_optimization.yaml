agents:
  analyzer:
    component: "components/personas/optimizers/component_analyzer"
    vars:
      initial_prompt: |
        Analyze the following component for optimization opportunities:
        {{component_content}}
        
        Focus on:
        - Token efficiency
        - Functional improvements
        - Instruction clarity
        - Behavioral effectiveness
        
        Provide specific, actionable recommendations.

  improver:
    component: "components/agents/comprehensive_component_improver"  
    vars:
      initial_prompt: |
        Based on this analysis:
        {{analyzer_recommendations}}
        
        Create an improved version of:
        {{component_content}}
        
        Emit the improved component via JSON event.

    1. SEND component_content TO analyzer

    3. SEND analyzer.recommendations AND component_content TO improver
    4. WAIT FOR improver.json_event
    5. RETURN improved_component
