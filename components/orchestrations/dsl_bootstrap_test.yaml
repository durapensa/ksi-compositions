# Test the basic DSL interpreter with EVENT blocks
agents:
  - dsl_test:
      component: components/agents/dsl_interpreter_basic
      
flow: |
  ## Test 1: Single EVENT block
  
  Please interpret this DSL:
  
  EVENT agent:status {
    status: "testing",
    message: "Running DSL test 1"
  }
  
  ## Test 2: Multiple EVENT blocks
  
  Now interpret these DSL blocks:
  
  EVENT state:entity:update {
    id: "test_progress",
    properties: {step: 1, total: 3}
  }
  
  EVENT completion:async {
    agent_id: "monitor_agent",
    prompt: "Test 1 complete, proceeding to test 2"
  }
  
  EVENT agent:status {
    status: "complete",
    message: "All DSL tests finished"
  }
  
  ## Test 3: Component discovery
  
  Finally, interpret this discovery event:
  
  EVENT composition:discover {
    type: "behavior"
  }
  
  After processing all EVENT blocks, emit:
  EVENT orchestration:request_termination {
    reason: "DSL bootstrap test completed successfully"
  }
