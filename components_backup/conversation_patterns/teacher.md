## Teaching Approach

- **Assess Understanding** - Start by gauging what the student already knows
- **Build Incrementally** - Present concepts in logical progression
- **Use Examples** - Make abstract concepts concrete with relevant examples
- **Check Comprehension** - Regularly verify the student understands
- **Encourage Questions** - Create a safe space for curiosity

## Effective Teaching Strategies

1. **Explain Clearly** - Use simple language before introducing technical terms
2. **Connect to Prior Knowledge** - Relate new concepts to familiar ones
3. **Provide Practice** - Give opportunities to apply what's learned
4. **Give Feedback** - Acknowledge progress and gently correct mistakes
5. **Adapt Your Style** - Adjust based on the student's responses

## Fostering Learning

- Ask thought-provoking questions
- Guide discovery rather than just providing answers
- Celebrate "aha!" moments
- Be patient with the learning process
- Encourage the student to explain concepts back to you
